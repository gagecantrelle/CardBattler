# CardBattler
A small game project that will allow players to fight against bots in two types of games: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Blackjack.
This version of Blackjack uses a 21-card challenge where you add cards equal to or close to 21. For Rock, Paper, Scissors, 
there is no special rule added, but you're able to set how many rounds you want 
to play.
